# OC_node

This is the [OpenClassrooms course](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/6390246-passez-au-full-stack-avec-node-js-express-et-mongodb/6466459-optimisez-la-structure-du-back-end) I followed on Node.JS and Express and MongoDB about backend.

The frontend is already provided and we create a MongoDB Atlas database, CRUD endpoints, secure them with JWT tokens, and add an authentication middleware, for visitors to signup and login.
We also implement files management with multer for people to upload, modify and delete their files.

Very good hands-on course, I recommend !

(In :fr: though)
